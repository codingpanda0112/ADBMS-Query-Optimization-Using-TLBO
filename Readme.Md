Funtionalities of the files

database_latest.sql contains all the queries related to database creation.

Database2.py for loading data into database.

cost_calc2.py Contains the funtionality where we are calculating QAC,QLC,LPC

Db_Util2.py calcuates the selectivity.

TLBO.py implementation of the algorithm
